This is an implementation of the static online algorithm bin packing with migration
described in "[Fully Dynamic Bin Packing Revisited](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0960.pdf)" by Berndt, Jansen, and Klein (APPROX 2015; Math. Prog. 2018).

For compilation, the [Apache Commons Math library](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) needs to be downloaded.
To compile, simply use
```shell
javac -cp commons-math3.jar:. TestBinPacking
```

To use the program, simply use:
```shell
java -c commons-math3.jar:. TestBinPacking inputFile
```

The inputFile is an XML file with the structure
```xml
<problem>
<number size="<SIZE>">
<number size="<SIZE>">
<number size="<SIZE>">
<number size="<SIZE>">
...
<number size="<SIZE>">
</list>
</problem>
```


For example, an instance containing three items with size 0.5, 0.4, and 0.2 is given as
```xml
<problem>
<number size="0.5">
<number size="0.4">
<number size="0.2">
</list>
</problem>
```
